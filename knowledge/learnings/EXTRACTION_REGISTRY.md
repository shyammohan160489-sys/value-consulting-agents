## Pipeline Gaps (capability learnings)

Structural gaps in the agent pipeline surfaced by live engagements — recurring deliverable archetypes
built bespoke because no skill/agent covers them. See `pipeline_gaps/`.

## Notes

- All extracted knowledge is anonymized (client names → bank type/region)
- Google-native files (.gslides, .gsheet) require manual PDF export before extraction
- Follow `knowledge/standards/context_management_protocol.md` for large files
- Update this registry after every extraction run
