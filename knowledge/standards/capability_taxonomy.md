# Capability Taxonomy: BIAN-Aligned with Backbase Terminology

**Standard:** BIAN Service Landscape (v13) mapped to the Backbase product surface
**Scale:** 0-4 Maturity (Absent → Fragmented → Defined → Orchestrated → Intelligent)
**Structure:** Front Layer / Middle Layer / Back Layer per capability

> **⚠️ Canonical product model:** [`knowledge/product/banking-os.md`](../product/banking-os.md) (substance) + [`knowledge/design-system/narrative-spine.md`](../design-system/narrative-spine.md) (voice). Read maturity as **distance from a Unified Frontline running on a control plane** — the top of every ladder is the bank "running as one" on **one shared truth (Nexus)** and **one governed execution engine (Sentinel)** with **Resolution-Loop coverage**, not "omnichannel context continuity" (a useful mid-rung, not the destination). Where a rung says "omnichannel," read it as a step toward the Unified Frontline, not the end state. (This pointer applies to the LOB variants — `_retail / _sme / _wealth / _commercial / _investing` — which inherit this ladder.)

## Part 1: Maturity Scale Definition

### The 0-4 Scale

| Level | Label | RAG Color | Hex | Observable Criteria |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----|---------------------|
| **0** | **Absent** | Red | `#E63946` | Capability doesn't exist. No process, no tool, no person performing this function. If needed, it either doesn't happen or is completely improvised. |
| **1** | **Fragmented** | Amber-Red | `#F4A261` | Capability exists but is ad-hoc. Person-dependent, inconsistent across channels/branches/teams. Manual workarounds. No standardization. Works sometimes, fails often. |
| **2** | **Defined** | Amber | `#E9C46A` | Standardized process exists. Tooling supports it. Roles are clear. Repeatable and consistent execution. But not end-to-end automated — handoffs are manual, measurement is limited. |
| **3** | **Orchestrated** | Green | `#2A9D8F` | End-to-end orchestrated. Automated where possible. Measured with KPIs. Cross-system integration works. Handoffs are seamless. Continuous improvement based on data. |
| **4** | **Intelligent** | Backbase Blue | `#0066FF` | AI-native. Predictive, self-optimizing. Agentic workflows handle routine cases autonomously. Real-time decisioning. Learning from data. Human-in-the-loop for exceptions only. |

### Scoring Rules

1. **Score what you observe, not what's planned.** A roadmap item is Level 0 until it's live.
2. **The overall score = the weakest layer.** A capability with Level 3 front but Level 0 back is scored Level 0 overall — the chain breaks at the weakest link.
3. **Each layer gets its own score** for the drill-down view, but the headline score reflects end-to-end maturity.
4. **Evidence required.** Every score must reference either a workshop observation, stakeholder quote, or documented assumption.
5. **Conservative bias.** When in doubt, score lower. It's better to underscore and be challenged upward than to overscore and lose credibility.

### How Probing Questions Determine the Level

Each capability has 4-5 probing questions, ordered by maturity level:

- **Q1 (Level 0→1 gate):** "Does this capability exist at all?" If no → Level 0.
- **Q2 (Level 1→2 gate):** "Is the process standardized and repeatable, or does it vary by person/location?" If varies → Level 1.
- **Q3 (Level 2→3 gate):** "Is the process automated end-to-end with measured handoffs and STP?" If manual handoffs remain → Level 2.
- **Q4 (Level 3→4 gate):** "Does AI/ML actively drive decisions, predict outcomes, or handle cases autonomously?" If no AI → Level 3.

## Part 2: Front / Middle / Back Layer Definitions

Every capability is assessed across three architectural layers, aligned with the Backbase Three-Plane Architecture:

| Layer | Backbase Plane | What It Covers | Example Components |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Front Layer** | Experience Plane | What the customer or employee sees and interacts with | Mobile app, web portal, employee workspace, branch UI, chatbot interface |
| **Middle Layer** | Capability Plane | What orchestrates, decides, and controls | HELIX, business rules, workflow engine, process orchestration, AI/ML models, entitlements |
| **Back Layer** | Integration Plane + Systems of Record | What connects, stores, and processes | Grand Central, core banking connectors, data warehouse, compliance systems, payment rails |

### Layer-Level Scoring

| Layer | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Front** | No channel exists | Basic UI, poor UX, incomplete | Polished UI, multi-channel, consistent | Omnichannel with context continuity | AI-personalized, adaptive, conversational |
| **Middle** | No process/logic | Manual steps, no orchestration | Defined workflows, basic automation | Fully orchestrated, STP, measured | AI decisioning, agentic execution, predictive |
| **Back** | No system integration | Point-to-point, fragile integrations | Managed connectors, data flows defined | Real-time integration, unified data | Data fabric, ML pipelines, semantic graph |

## Part 5: Unconsidered Needs Library

These are problems that banks typically have NOT raised but should be assessed. The capability assessment agent MUST proactively surface relevant unconsidered needs based on the domain being assessed.

### Retail Banking Unconsidered Needs

| ID | Problem | Why Banks Miss It | Related Capabilities |
|----|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| UN-R-01 | Silent customer churn — customers disengage gradually with no detection | Banks measure churn as account closure, not behavioral disengagement | CAP-R-CL-03, CAP-R-DI-01, CAP-R-AI-01 |
| UN-R-02 | Employee context-switching tax — staff toggle 5+ systems per interaction | Accepted as "how things work," never measured as a cost | CAP-R-CE-02, CAP-R-PO-01 |
| UN-R-03 | No front-to-back journey visibility — process breaks are invisible | Each department sees only their part; no end-to-end view | CAP-R-PO-01, CAP-R-DI-02 |
| UN-R-04 | Data exists but isn't used — customer insights trapped in silos | Banks have data but no intelligence layer to act on it | CAP-R-DI-01, CAP-R-CL-03, CAP-R-AI-02 |
| UN-R-05 | Compliance is cost, not value — KYC/AML treated as overhead, not a trust signal | Banks see compliance as a box-ticking exercise, not a differentiator | CAP-R-RC-01, CAP-R-AI-03 |
| UN-R-06 | No AI strategy — bank has no roadmap for embedding intelligence | AI is either ignored or stuck in pilot purgatory | CAP-R-AI-01, CAP-R-AI-02, CAP-R-AI-03 |

### Wealth Management Unconsidered Needs

| ID | Problem | Why Banks Miss It | Related Capabilities |
|----|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| UN-W-01 | Advisors spend more time on admin than clients | Accepted as normal; never measured as revenue opportunity cost | CAP-W-EE-01, CAP-W-AI-02 |
| UN-W-02 | No proactive life-event detection | Advisors wait for clients to call; missed intervention windows | CAP-W-CL-03, CAP-W-AI-01 |
| UN-W-03 | Client assets leaking to competitors undetected | Transfer patterns to external brokerages not monitored | CAP-W-DI-01, CAP-W-CL-03 |
| UN-W-04 | Referral decay — leads go cold before advisor contact | No urgency scoring; no speed-to-contact measurement | CAP-W-CE-03, CAP-W-PO-01 |
| UN-W-05 | Complexity mismatch — simple clients overserved, complex clients underserved | No systematic matching of client complexity to advisor tier | CAP-W-CL-02, CAP-W-EE-01 |

### SME Banking Unconsidered Needs

| ID | Problem | Why Banks Miss It | Related Capabilities |
|----|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| UN-S-01 | SME treated as "small retail" — no business-specific digital tools | SME is a cost center; investment goes to retail or commercial | CAP-S-CE-01, CAP-S-RB-02 |
| UN-S-02 | Cash flow blindness — business owners can't see forward cash position | Banks provide balances, not forecasts; seen as the business's problem | CAP-S-RB-02, CAP-S-DI-01 |
| UN-S-03 | Onboarding friction kills NTB — 40%+ abandonment on business accounts | Measured by applications started, not by those lost before starting | CAP-S-CL-01, CAP-S-RC-01 |
| UN-S-04 | No cross-sell engine — product penetration is 1.5 products per SME | RMs don't have time or data; digital offers don't exist | CAP-S-CL-03, CAP-S-DI-01, CAP-S-AI-02 |
| UN-S-05 | Lending leakage to fintechs — SMEs get loans elsewhere because bank is too slow | Banks track declined applications but not "never applied because too slow" | CAP-S-DL-01, CAP-S-PO-01 |
| UN-S-06 | RM model unsustainable — SME RMs carry 200+ relationships with no digital leverage | Accepted as normal; RM workload never quantified against revenue per client | CAP-S-CE-02, CAP-S-AI-02 |

### Commercial Banking Unconsidered Needs

| ID | Problem | Why Banks Miss It | Related Capabilities |
|----|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| UN-C-01 | Onboarding takes weeks/months — clients generate zero revenue during setup | Onboarding seen as compliance necessity, not revenue delay | CAP-C-CL-01, CAP-C-PO-01 |
| UN-C-02 | RM can't see share-of-wallet — no visibility into competitor relationships | No multi-bank data; RM relies on client self-reporting | CAP-C-CE-02, CAP-C-DI-01 |
| UN-C-03 | Payment operations are people-heavy — manual repair rates above 10% | "Payment ops has always been manual" — cost never questioned | CAP-C-PT-01, CAP-C-PO-01 |
| UN-C-04 | Trade finance is paper-based — LCs and BGs still require physical documents | Seen as industry norm; digitization efforts haven't reached trade | CAP-C-TF-01, CAP-C-TF-02 |
| UN-C-05 | Entitlement management is a bottleneck — adding/changing users takes days | Buried in IT tickets; never measured as client experience friction | CAP-C-RC-02, CAP-C-PO-01 |
| UN-C-06 | No self-service for corporate clients — every request goes through the RM | Seen as "high-touch service"; actually a cost and speed bottleneck | CAP-C-CE-01, CAP-C-EE-01 |

### Corporate Banking Unconsidered Needs

| ID | Problem | Why Banks Miss It | Related Capabilities |
|----|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| UN-CO-01 | Treasury visibility gap — treasurers can't see real-time global positions | Bank provides EOD statements; intraday visibility requires manual aggregation | CAP-CO-RB-01, CAP-CO-RB-02, CAP-CO-INT-02 |
| UN-CO-02 | Integration onboarding costs more than the product margin in year 1 | Integration is "the client's problem"; bank doesn't track onboarding cost | CAP-CO-INT-01, CAP-CO-CL-01 |
| UN-CO-03 | Compliance screening false positives consume analyst capacity | High false positive rates accepted as "the cost of compliance" | CAP-CO-RC-02, CAP-CO-AI-01 |
| UN-CO-04 | No predictive treasury — liquidity management is reactive, not anticipatory | Seen as the treasurer's job, not a bank service opportunity | CAP-CO-RB-02, CAP-CO-AI-01 |
| UN-CO-05 | Multi-bank experience is fragmented — clients manage each bank separately | Banks don't incentivize multi-bank views; locks out competitor visibility | CAP-CO-INT-02, CAP-CO-DI-01 |
| UN-CO-06 | Cross-border payment costs are opaque — clients can't compare corridor costs | Fee transparency seen as margin risk; actually a trust and retention issue | CAP-CO-PT-02, CAP-CO-PT-01 |

## Part 6: Problem Statement Categories

Problems identified in discovery or workshops should be classified as:

### Considered Needs
Problems the bank is **already aware of** and actively trying to solve. These validate existing initiatives and provide cost/impact data.

### Unconsidered Needs
Problems the bank **hasn't thought of** or doesn't realize they have. These are high-value because they create new urgency and differentiate the assessment from what the bank already knows.

Every problem links to capabilities that solve it:

```
Problem Statement: [Title]
├── Type: Considered | Unconsidered
├── Severity: Critical | High | Medium | Low
├── Impact: [Quantified where possible]
├── Metrics: [Observable indicators]
└── Related Capabilities: [CAP-IDs that solve this problem]

## Part 11: How to Use This Taxonomy

### In a Workshop
1. Start with Problem Statements (considered + unconsidered)
2. For each problem, identify related capabilities from this catalog
3. Score each capability 0-4 using the probing questions
4. Score each layer (Front/Middle/Back) separately
5. Capture notes and evidence for each score
6. Export data for heatmap visualization

### From a Transcript (No Workshop)
1. Extract problem statements from stakeholder quotes
2. Map quotes to capabilities as evidence
3. Infer maturity levels based on descriptions (conservative bias)
4. Flag capabilities with no evidence as "assumed" with validation needed
5. Proactively surface unconsidered needs based on domain patterns

### Per-Domain Application
- **Retail Banking:** Use CAP-R-* capabilities (Part 4)
- **Wealth Management:** Use CAP-W-* capabilities (Part 7)
- **SME/Business Banking:** Use CAP-S-* capabilities (Part 8)
- **Commercial Banking:** Use CAP-C-* capabilities (Part 9)
