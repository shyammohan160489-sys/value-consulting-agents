# Backbase Platform Lexicon & Architecture Reference

A comprehensive reference guide for Backbase terminology, platform architecture, and product capabilities.

> **⚠️ CANONICAL SOURCE — read this first.** The authoritative, current product direction is **[`knowledge/product/banking-os.md`](product/banking-os.md)** (June 2026): Banking OS = the **Control Plane** of the unified frontline · layers **Nexus** (shared source of truth) + **Sentinel** (governed, auditable execution) + Orchestration + Connectivity + Intelligence · **2 domains** (Customer Engagement · Banking Operations) → **4 solutions** (Digital Banking · Conversational Banking [Assist/Transact/Resolve/Grow] · Relationship Intelligence · Customer Operations / Resolution Loops) · **Factory / Mission Sprints** delivery (6–12 wks) · three value pools (cost −20-40% · uplift +10-25% · AI-to-prod 3–5×). Voice lives in [`narrative-spine.md`](design-system/narrative-spine.md). **Where this lexicon describes an older model (13 product lines, 3-fabric / 3-plane architecture, Acquire/Activate/Expand/Retain flywheel), `banking-os.md` supersedes it.** Treat the sections below as background detail, re-based on the canonical model above.

---

## Part 1: Strategic Framework

### The Unified Frontline Vision

**Core Problem: Frontline Fragmentation**
Banks typically operate 20-40 disconnected apps, workflows, and tools creating:
- No shared customer truth across channels
- Long fulfillment times (days/weeks instead of minutes/hours)
- Manual steps everywhere driving high cost-to-serve
- Employees juggling multiple screens and systems
- Inconsistent customer experience across channels
- AI stuck in pilots with no orchestration layer

**Solution: Unified Frontline**
A single customer operating system that transforms fragmented frontline systems into a connected growth engine.

### Customer Lifecycle Model

The Backbase platform orchestrates the entire customer lifecycle through four stages. Each stage spans multiple product lines — the quadrant mapping below shows the *primary* quadrant, but products from all quadrants participate in every stage.

| Stage | Definition | Primary Quadrant | What This Stage Covers |
|-------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Acquire** | Attract prospects, convert them into customers, and complete their onboarding | Onboarding & Origination | Prospecting, lead management, marketing, application, origination, KYC/onboarding, account creation, initial product setup |
| **Activate** | Enable customers to use the platform for daily banking and complete their first key transactions | Digital Banking | Account activation, first transaction, digital channel adoption, daily banking operations (payments, transfers, cash management), initial product usage |
| **Expand** | Grow share of wallet through cross-sell, upsell, and proactive engagement based on customer needs | Engagement & Expansion | Cross-sell/upsell origination, next best action, pre-approved offers, product bundling, engagement campaigns, life-event triggers, AUM growth (wealth) |
| **Retain** | Reduce cost-to-serve through self-service, resolve issues efficiently, and prevent churn through proactive engagement | Human Assist + Digital Banking | Self-service operations, issue resolution, dispute management, portfolio reviews, proactive retention, loyalty programs, churn prediction, cost-to-serve optimization |

### The Unified Banking Suite (Four Quadrants)

```
         ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
         │   Onboarding    │     Digital     │
acquire→ │  & Origination  │    Banking      │ →activate
         ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
         │  Engagement     │     Human       │
expand←  │  & Expansion    │     Assist      │ ←retain
         └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

> **Note:** The quadrant model shows primary associations. In practice, Digital Banking serves Activate, Expand, AND Retain (self-service). Human Assist participates in Expand (RM-driven cross-sell) as well as Retain. Engagement & Expansion drives Retain (proactive retention) as well as Expand. The lifecycle stages are *customer outcome-oriented*; the quadrants are *platform architecture-oriented*.

## Part 2: Platform Architecture

### Platform Evolution

The Backbase platform has evolved through distinct eras:

| Era | Period | Platform Identity | Key Innovation |
|-----|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Bank 2.0 Portal** | 2011-2013 | Widget App Store | Vertical specialization into financial services |
| **CXP** | 2016-2019 | Customer Experience Platform | Omnichannel orchestration |
| **Engagement Banking** | 2022-2023 | Engagement Banking Platform (EBP) | Model Banks, platform economics (€120M funding) |
| **AI-Native** | 2024-2025 | AI-powered Banking Platform | Agentic autonomy, Intelligence Fabric, Agent Studio |
| **Semantic Intelligence** | 2026+ | AI-native Banking Operating System | **NEXUS**, Semantic Fabric, autonomous banking |

### Architecture — Three Fabrics

The current Backbase architecture is organized into **three fabrics** (evolved from the earlier three-plane model):

| Fabric | Assessment Layer | What It Covers | Key Components |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Digital Banking Fabric** | **Front Layer** | Customer and employee experiences across channels | Customer Apps (Mobile + Web), Employee Workspaces (CSR, RM/Advisor, Operations), Prospect Portal, AI Co-Pilots, Model Bank Apps |
| **Data + AI Fabric** | **Middle Layer** | Intelligence, orchestration, semantic understanding, and agentic execution | **NEXUS** (Customer State Graph, Semantic Banking Ontology), Agent Studio, Agent Orchestration, Process Automation (Flow), Entitlements & Access Control, Data Foundation, Intelligence Fabric |
| **Integration Fabric** | **Back Layer** | Connectivity to systems of record and third-party services | **Grand Central** (iPaaS), Connector Studio, 100+ Pre-built Connectors, Unified Domain Model, API Management, Fintech Marketplace |

> **Assessment mapping:** For capability assessments, the three fabrics map directly to Front/Middle/Back (F/M/B) scoring layers. The overall capability score = the weakest layer (weakest-link principle).

### Horizontal Service Layers

Across the three fabrics, the platform exposes these horizontal service layers:

| Service Layer | Description | Key Components |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Presentation Services** | UI frameworks and app shells | Model Bank Apps, AI Co-Pilots, Widget Engine, Design System |
| **Banking Services** | Composable banking microservices | Accounts, Payments, Cards, Lending, Investing |
| **Process Automation Services** | Journey and workflow orchestration | Flow Foundation, Business Rules Engine, Form Builder |
| **Agentic Services** | AI agent development and execution | Agent Studio, Agent Orchestration, Agent Marketplace |
| **Semantic Services** | Customer intelligence and ontology | **NEXUS** — Customer State Graph, Semantic Banking Ontology |
| **Integration Services** | System connectivity | Grand Central, Connector Studio, Unified Domain Model |
| **Entitlements Services** | Access control and permissions | Role-based access, multi-level approvals, limits management |
| **Security Services** | Identity and authentication | Platform Identity, FIDO2, Biometric, Fraud Prevention |
| **Marketplace** | Partner ecosystem | Fintech integrations, add-on connectors |
| **Managed Hosting** | Cloud operations | Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS), cloud infrastructure |
| **Agentic SDLC** | AI-assisted development | Upgrade agents, Knowledge agents (Ask IO), legacy modernization |

### NEXUS — The Semantic Fabric (2026+)

NEXUS is the next evolution of the Customer Brain (previously called HELIX). It provides the semantic intelligence layer that makes autonomous banking possible:

**Core Components:**

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Customer State Graph** | Single real-time truth about every customer — across all channels, products, and systems. This is the "one customer view" that every AI agent and human employee accesses. |
| **Semantic Banking Ontology** | Shared domain language for every system and AI model. Ensures that "savings account" means the same thing to the core banking system, the mobile app, and the AI agent. |
| **Action & Behavior Layer** | Exposes "what can be done" to every UI and AI — a catalog of available actions (open account, make payment, file dispute) that any interface can invoke. |
| **Agentic Intelligence Layer** | Real-time decisioning, recommendations, and automation. Powers next-best-action, risk scoring, churn prediction, and autonomous case handling. |
| **Trust & Control Layer** | Policy enforcement, audit trails, and secure orchestration. Ensures AI agents operate within governance boundaries. |
| **Unified Journeys & Workflows** | Consistent end-to-end operations across channels and systems. A journey started on mobile continues on web, in-branch, or via AI agent with full context. |

> **NEXUS vs. HELIX:** NEXUS is the evolution of the HELIX concept (Customer Brain). While HELIX focused on being a "unified frontline control plane," NEXUS adds the semantic layer that enables true autonomous banking — AI agents that understand banking domain concepts natively.

### Legacy Plane Terminology (for reference)

Earlier Backbase documentation uses a "three plane" model. This maps to the current fabric model:

| Legacy Term | Current Term | Assessment Layer |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Experience Plane (System of Engagement) | Digital Banking Fabric | Front Layer |
| Capability Plane (System of Intelligence) | Data + AI Fabric | Middle Layer |
| Integration Plane (System of Integration) | Integration Fabric | Back Layer |

### Grand Central - Integration Platform
