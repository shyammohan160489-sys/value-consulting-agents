## How Agents Connect

Agents share information through **ENGAGEMENT_CONTEXT.md** - a standardized file that accumulates findings from each workshop. Each agent:

1. **Reads** the context file (if provided)
2. **Uses** prior findings to inform its output
3. **Updates** the context with new validated information

---

# 3. QUICK START GUIDE

## Option A: Single Unified Project (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most engagements, smaller teams, simpler management

### Step 1: Create the Project
1. Go to claude.ai → Projects → Create Project
2. Name it: `Ignite AI Agent`
3. Description: "Generates Ignite value consulting deliverables"

### Step 2: Upload Agent Instructions
1. In Project Knowledge, upload ALL CLAUDE.md files:
   - `agent-1-strategy/CLAUDE.md`
   - `agent-2-member/CLAUDE.md`
   - `agent-3-employee/CLAUDE.md`
   - `agent-4-architecture/CLAUDE.md`
   - `agent-5-usecase/CLAUDE.md`
   - `agent-6-presentation/CLAUDE.md`
   - `agent-7-roi/CLAUDE.md`
2. Also upload `ENGAGEMENT_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`

### Step 3: Start an Engagement
Start a new conversation and use trigger phrases:

```
"Start a new Ignite engagement for [Client Name]. They are a [bank/credit union] 
with [X] customers/members and [$X] in assets. Generate the Strategy Workshop deck."
```

### Step 4: Progress Through Agents
Use trigger phrases to activate different agents:

| To Generate | Say |
|-------------|-----|
| Strategy deck | "Generate the Strategy Workshop deck" |
| Member Experience deck | "Generate the Member Experience Workshop deck" |
| Employee Experience deck | "Generate the Employee Experience Workshop deck" |
| IT Architecture deck | "Generate the IT Architecture Workshop deck" |
| Use Case Documents | "Create use case design documents and prototypes" |
| ROI Questionnaire | "Generate the ROI questionnaire" |
| Business Case | "Build the business case from this questionnaire" |
| Final Presentation | "Compile the Ignite Day presentation" |

---

## Option B: Separate Projects per Agent

**Best for:** Large teams, sharing specific agents, maximum flexibility

### Setup
Create 7 separate Claude Projects:

| Project Name | Upload |
|--------------|--------|
| Ignite - Strategy Workshop | `agent-1-strategy/CLAUDE.md` |
| Ignite - Member Experience | `agent-2-member/CLAUDE.md` |
| Ignite - Employee Experience | `agent-3-employee/CLAUDE.md` |
| Ignite - IT Architecture | `agent-4-architecture/CLAUDE.md` |
| Ignite - Use Case Design | `agent-5-usecase/CLAUDE.md` |
| Ignite - Presentation | `agent-6-presentation/CLAUDE.md` |
| Ignite - ROI Business Case | `agent-7-roi/CLAUDE.md` |

### Workflow
1. Run Agent 1, download updated ENGAGEMENT_CONTEXT.md
2. Upload context to Agent 2, run, download updated context
3. Continue through agents as needed
4. Pass context file between projects manually

4. **Include specific data** - Numbers, percentages, not vague statements
5. **Note sources** - Reference where information came from

---

# 7. BEST PRACTICES

## Prompting Tips

### DO ✅

```
✅ "Generate the Strategy Workshop deck for First National Bank. 
   They are a regional bank with 200,000 customers and $5B in assets, 
   headquartered in Ohio. Their strategic priority is digital transformation 
   of lending. Include competitive analysis against Huntington and KeyBank."

✅ "Create use case documents for these P1 priorities:
   1. Digital Account Opening
   2. Personal Loan Application  
   3. 360° Customer View
   Include prototypes for each."

✅ "Build the business case using the attached completed questionnaire.
   The client has confirmed these value levers are in scope:
   - Account opening (in scope)
   - Lending origination (in scope)
   - Branch transformation (out of scope)"
```

### DON'T ❌

```
❌ "Make me a deck" (too vague)

❌ "Generate everything for BECU" (no specific agent/output)

❌ "Create the business case" (without questionnaire data)
```

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Definition of done is measurable
- [ ] Prototypes match documented flow

### For Business Case (Agent 7)

## Terminology Rules

| If Client Is | Use | Not |
|--------------|-----|-----|
| Credit Union | Member | Customer |
| Credit Union | Membership | Account Opening |
| Bank | Customer | Member |
| Any | Branch/Financial Center | Store |
| Any | Digital Banking | Online Banking |

---

# 8. TROUBLESHOOTING

## Common Issues

### "The agent isn't using the right terminology"

**Solution**: Be explicit in your prompt:
```
"This is a CREDIT UNION. Use 'Member' terminology throughout, 
never 'Customer'."
```

### "The hypotheses are too generic"

**Solution**: Ask for specifics:
```
"Make hypotheses more specific. Include:
- Quantified claims (percentages, dollar amounts)
- Business impact for each
- Specific validation questions"
```

### "The competitive analysis is missing"

**Solution**: Explicitly request it:
```
"Include competitive benchmarking. Search for:
- [Competitor 1] mobile app rating
- [Competitor 2] digital banking capabilities
Compare against [Client] on key metrics."
```

### "The prototype doesn't match the use case"

**Solution**: Ensure use case is defined first:
```
"First, show me the complete happy path for UC-001 Digital Account Opening.
Then generate the prototype following that exact flow."
```

### "Agent 7 ROI seems too high/low"

**Solution**: Review assumptions:
```
"The ROI of [X]% seems [high/low]. Please:
1. List all assumptions used
2. Show calculation for each value lever
3. Identify which assumptions have highest impact
4. Run sensitivity analysis"
```
