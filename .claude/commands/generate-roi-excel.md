# Generate ROI Excel Model

Generate a professional ROI Excel model following the Backbase Value Consulting methodology (HNB/Seabank format).

> **Canon — read first.** Align this model's value narrative to `knowledge/product/banking-os.md` (Banking OS product substance: control plane · Nexus + Sentinel · 2 domains → 4 solutions [Digital Banking, Conversational Banking, Relationship Intelligence, Customer Operations] · Factory/Missions · three value pools) and `knowledge/design-system/narrative-spine.md` (voice: operating-model thesis, From→To, vocabulary). Where lever labels reference onboarding, treat "Digital Onboarding" as the onboarding *process/journey*, not a retired product module. Retire "engagement banking" / "better channels". Where other repo files diverge, banking-os.md wins.

## What This Skill Does

Creates a comprehensive Excel ROI model with:
- Multiple sheets (Cover, Instructions, Dashboard, Inputs, Cashflows, Servicing, Scenarios, Assumptions)
- Scenario-based modeling (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
- Implementation & Effectiveness curves by year
- Lever-by-lever benefit breakdown
- Servicing task analysis with Backbase impact
- All assumptions documented with sources
- **Tech Rationalization tab** (when CIO/CFO are primary stakeholders)

## Usage

```
/generate-roi-excel
```

Then provide:
1. Client name
2. Evidence register or discovery findings
3. Key financial data (customer base, revenue, costs)
4. Specific levers to model

## Example

```
/generate-roi-excel

Client: First National Bank
Region: SEA
Currency: USD

Evidence:
- E1: 13,000 wealth customers
- E2: 250 annual onboardings
- E3: RMs spend 2 hours/day on admin
- E4: Onboarding takes 5+ days
- E5: 40 RMs serving 300 clients each

Levers to model:
- Prospecting improvement
- Digital onboarding
- Servicing efficiency
```

## Output

An Excel file will be generated at the specified path with:
- Working formulas
- Editable input cells (highlighted in blue)
- Calculated outputs
- Charts and visualizations
- Complete assumptions register

## Template Location

The generator script is at: `tools/roi_excel_generator.py`

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Gather Required Inputs:**
   - Client name and basic info
   - Evidence register (if available)
   - Key metrics: customer base, revenue, staff costs
   - Levers to include in the model

2. **Prepare Configuration:**
   - Structure the data into the required JSON format
   - Calculate baseline values for each lever
   - Define three scenarios with different impact assumptions
   - Document all assumptions with sources

3. **Generate the Model:**
   - Use the ROIModelGenerator class from tools/roi_excel_generator.py
   - Save to the outputs folder with client name in filename

4. **Validate Output:**
   - Open the Excel file and verify formulas work
   - Check that scenarios produce different results
   - Ensure all assumptions are documented

## Tech Rationalization Tab (CIO/CFO Stakeholders)

**When to Include:** If `primary_stakeholder_types` includes `technology` or `finance`, add a **Tech Rationalization** sheet.

**Reference Data:** `knowledge/learnings/roi_models/tech_rationalization_decommission.md`

### Tech Rationalization Sheet Structure

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Legacy Cost Stack** | Annual costs by category (core banking, originations, bill pay, P2P, middleware, etc.) |
| **Marketplace Costs** | Per-transaction costs for onboarding services (KYC, identity verification, etc.) |
| **Per-User Costs** | Monthly per-user costs for digital banking services |
| **Growth Projections** | Year-over-year user growth with legacy cost escalation |
| **Backbase TCO** | License + implementation + marketplace + ongoing costs |
| **5-Year Comparison** | Side-by-side NPV: Legacy vs. Backbase |
| **Savings Summary** | Annual savings, cumulative savings, NPV impact |
