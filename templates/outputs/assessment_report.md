> **TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE NOTICE — READ BEFORE GENERATING**
>
> This template defines the MANDATORY structure of the Ignite Assess deliverable. ALL 7 sections must be present in the final report. No section may be omitted, summarized to a paragraph, or replaced with a placeholder.
>
> **Section 05 (Capability Assessment)** must contain the FULL capability assessment — the complete F/M/B heatmap, problem map, capability drill-downs, traceability matrix, path to target, and Data & AI readiness. This is NOT a summary referencing a separate document. It IS the document. Expect 200+ lines.
>
> **Section 04 (Deep-Dive Assessment)** must contain value leakage funnels for each lifecycle stage, journey maps with swim-lane process flows, named persona profiles, and solution component mapping with specific Backbase product names. Expect 150+ lines.
>
> **Section 01 (Strategic Alignment)** is the longest section — 30-40% of the total report. It builds the emotional and data-backed case for change. If this section is thin or generic, the report fails.
>
> A report that omits acts, produces high-level summaries instead of detailed analysis, or skips the capability assessment is NOT DELIVERABLE. Go back and complete it.

> **Open on From→To, anchor on the operating model, not channels:**
> - **FROM — frontline fragmentation** (a losing formula): 6–12 systems per journey · 30–60% manual work · high cost-to-serve · slow cycles · AI stuck in pilots · **~60% of the bank's work in the whitespace *between* systems**.
> - **TO — a Unified Frontline that runs the bank as one:** customers, employees, and AI agents on **one shared truth and one execution engine**, governed and auditable.
> - **Backbase = the AI-Native Banking OS — the *control plane* of the Unified Frontline.** Name **Nexus** (shared source of customer truth) and **Sentinel** (governed, auditable execution) where credible.
> - **Map every opportunity to the 4 solutions:** Digital Banking · Conversational Banking (Assist · Transact · Resolve · Grow) · Relationship Intelligence · Customer Operations. **Do NOT use the deprecated names** Grand Central, Digital Engage, Digital Assist, Data Foundations, "AI & Agentic" as products — they are superseded.
> - **Recast value-leakage funnels as Customer Resolution Loops** (capture intent → coordinate fulfilment → return outcome) and **quantify against the three value pools:** cost-to-serve ↓20–40% · conversion/cross-sell/retention ↑10–25% · AI approval-to-production 3–5× → $150–300M+.

## 01. Level Setting — Our Understanding of [Client]'s Goals & Hurdles

### Strategic Objectives

[Group-level objectives synthesized from discovery workshops and assessment meetings. Frame as 3-5 strategic pillars the client has articulated.]

1. **[Objective 1]:** [Description — e.g., "Digital innovation with one unified experience across channels and lines of business"]
2. **[Objective 2]:** [Description — e.g., "Deepen customer relationships and keep value within the ecosystem"]
3. **[Objective 3]:** [Description — e.g., "Scale advisory capacity without proportional cost increase"]
4. **[Objective 4]:** [Description — e.g., "Data-driven decision making across operations"]

### The Opportunity

[Market sizing and growth potential. Frame what's at stake — the addressable market, the customer base potential, the revenue upside.]

| Segment | Current State | Potential |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| [Segment 1] | [Current metrics] | [Growth opportunity] |
| [Segment 2] | [Current metrics] | [Growth opportunity] |
| [Segment 3] | [Current metrics] | [Growth opportunity] |

### Financial Position in Context

*[Optional — include if Market Context Module 1 data is available]*

[Connect the client's published financial metrics to the opportunity. Show where they stand vs. peers and what the numbers mean for the transformation case.]

| Metric | [Client] | Peer Median | Best-in-Class | Gap | Provenance |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|-----|-----------|
| Cost-to-Income | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | [+/- Xpp] | [Annual Report / Investor Deck] |
| Digital Adoption | [X]% | [Y]% | [Z]% | [-Xpp] | [Source] |
| [Domain-specific] | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [Gap] | [Source] |

[Narrative connecting these metrics to the transformation opportunity. E.g., "The 8pp cost-to-income gap above the peer median represents approximately $[X]M in annual excess operating cost. Our assessment identified $[Y]M of this as addressable through digital channel shift and process automation."]

### Customer Life Moments

[Map customer life stages to banking needs and where the bank can capture value. Make this human and emotional — this is the "who are we doing this for" section.]

| Life Moment | Banking Need | Where [Client] Captures Value | Current State |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| [e.g., "Just started earning"] | [e.g., "First salary account, budgeting tools"] | [e.g., "Acquisition, daily banking"] | [e.g., "No digital-first onboarding for young segment"] |
| [e.g., "Building a family"] | [e.g., "Home loan, insurance, child savings plan"] | [e.g., "Cross-sell, deepen relationship"] | [e.g., "Products exist but no proactive advisory triggers"] |
| [e.g., "Children's education"] | [e.g., "Education savings, investment planning"] | [e.g., "AUM growth, advisory fees"] | [e.g., "No goal-based savings capability"] |
| [e.g., "Pre-retirement"] | [e.g., "Wealth consolidation, retirement income"] | [e.g., "Wealth retention, inter-generational transfer"] | [e.g., "Manual advisory, no digital wealth tools"] |

[Narrative: "Every life moment is an opportunity to deepen the relationship — or lose the customer to a competitor who meets them where they are."]

### The Catalyst — Why Now

[What is the trigger for change? Frame around market shifts, competitive pressure, regulatory change, or internal strategic mandate. This is the "why now" — make it urgent and compelling.]

### Competitive Landscape

*[Optional — include if Market Context Module 2 or Module 3 data is available]*

[Show what the market looks like from the outside-in. What are digital leaders doing? What do customers experience elsewhere?]

**What digital leaders in [country/region] are doing:**

| Competitor / Leader | What They Offer | Relevance to [Client] |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| [e.g., "GXS Bank"] | [e.g., "Instant account opening, <5 min onboarding with eKYC"] | [e.g., "Client's 7-day cycle is losing the young segment"] |
| [e.g., "DBS digibank"] | [e.g., "68% digital containment, AI-powered servicing"] | [e.g., "Client at 20% containment — 3x cost differential"] |

*[If CX data available:]* [Client] mobile app rating: [X]/5 vs. peer average [Y]/5. Top customer complaints: "[Z]".

*[If no competitor data available for domain:]* "Public competitive capability data is limited for [wealth/commercial] banking in [country]. However, regional trends from [source] indicate [relevant trend]."

### Key Challenges Faced Today

[Summarize 4-6 current challenges as headlines with brief descriptions. These come directly from discovery evidence. If financial metric correlations are available, connect challenges to top-line impact.]

| Challenge | Description | Business Impact | Financial Link |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **[Challenge 1]** | [e.g., "Group-wide digital fragmentation"] | [Impact — e.g., "Inconsistent CX, duplicated investment"] | [e.g., "Contributes to C/I gap of +8pp"] |
| **[Challenge 2]** | [e.g., "Manual operating model & constrained capacity"] | [Impact] | [Financial link if available] |
| **[Challenge 3]** | [e.g., "Profitability & risk concentration"] | [Impact] | [Financial link if available] |
| **[Challenge 4]** | [e.g., "Data trapped in silos"] | [Impact] | [Financial link if available] |

### The Legacy Trap

[Visualize the current architecture problem. Describe the siloed systems landscape that is blocking CX and productivity gains. Name the specific systems and integration pain points discovered.]

**Current State Architecture (Simplified):**

| Layer | What Exists Today | Pain |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| **Customer Channels** | [List: mobile app, internet banking, branch, etc.] | [Fragmented, inconsistent] |
| **Employee Tools** | [List: CRM, back-office, manual systems] | [Context switching, no 360 view] |
| **Integration** | [List: point-to-point, batch files, manual handoffs] | [No orchestration, brittle] |
| **Core Systems** | [List: core banking, payments, etc.] | [Legacy, limited API exposure] |

### The Cost of Standing Still

[Quantify what happens if the organization does nothing. This bridges Act 1 to Act 2 — creating urgency for the vision.]

| Inaction Consequence | Quantified Impact | Timeframe |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| [e.g., "Continued customer attrition to digital-first competitors"] | [e.g., "$[X]M revenue at risk annually"] | [e.g., "Already happening"] |
| [e.g., "Rising cost-to-serve as manual processes scale linearly"] | [e.g., "$[X]M additional cost over 3 years"] | [e.g., "Accelerating"] |
| [e.g., "Regulatory non-compliance risk"] | [e.g., "Fines, license risk"] | [e.g., "[Date/deadline]"] |

---

*[NARRATIVE BRIDGE: "Having mapped [Client]'s strategic ambitions against the realities of today's operations — from the [X]pp cost-to-income gap to the [Y]-day onboarding cycles — the question becomes: what does the future look like? The following section outlines the platform vision that addresses these challenges systematically."]*

# SECTION 2: The Vision

---

## 02. The Unified Frontline on the Banking OS — Long-Term Transformation

### [Client] Tomorrow — The Unified Frontline

[Describe the **TO** state. The bank runs **as one**: customers, employees, and AI agents collaborating on **one shared truth and one execution engine, with explicit authorization for every action**. Backbase is the **AI-Native Banking OS — the control plane** that coordinates and governs the work across the frontline and hundreds of downstream systems. Add-on-top, no rip-and-replace.]

**The control plane (name the layers where credible):**
- **Nexus — the shared source of customer truth** (UNDERSTAND): one real-time truth across core, CRM, LMS, credit — so customers, employees and agents share context. The system of *truth*, not a data lake.
- **Sentinel — governed, auditable execution** (AUTHORIZE): authority · policies · entitlements; humans *and* agents stay within guardrails; immutable audit.
- **Orchestration · Connectivity/Integration · Intelligence** layers coordinate, connect, and optimize the work.

**The product surface — 2 domains → 4 solutions** (map this client's opportunities to these):
- **Digital Banking** — modernize the digital foundation (Retail · SME · Commercial · Wealth)
- **Conversational Banking** — natural-language interface for customers *and* employees: **Assist · Transact · Resolve · Grow**
- **Relationship Intelligence** — bank-owned AI for financial progress & growth (Financial Wellness + Share of Wallet)
- **Customer Operations** — close the loop from trigger to resolved outcome via **Resolution Loops**

**Key principles:**
- **Operating model, not channels:** the bank runs as one on shared truth + one execution engine
- **Governed agentic execution:** explicit authorization for every action (Sentinel)
- **Add-on-top:** progressive, no big-bang rip-and-replace
- **Land fast, prove value, expand:** one use case live in 6–12 weeks (Factory Missions), then light up the next solution on the same Banking OS

### Progressive Modernization Approach

[Describe the phased approach to transformation. Frame as progressive modernization — each phase builds on the previous.]

| Phase | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Set the Foundation** | Unified platform, core journeys | Modern front-end, orchestration layer |
| **Build Differentiation** | Advanced journeys, intelligence | Data-driven engagement, automation |
| **Accelerate Growth** | AI, agentic workflows, ecosystem | Self-optimizing, proactive banking |

### [Client]'s Journey — Progressive Modernization

[Map phases across lines of business. Show which LoB starts first (the lighthouse) and how the platform is reused.]

| | Phase 1 (Lighthouse) | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[LoB 1 — e.g., Wealth]** | MVP: Core journeys | Advanced advisory | AI-native |
| **[LoB 2 — e.g., Retail]** | — | Onboarding + servicing | Full digital banking |
| **[LoB 3 — e.g., SME]** | — | — | Extend platform |

### Core Value Proposition — Mapped to the 4 Solutions

[Map the value proposition to the **4 Banking OS solutions** (and Conversational Banking's Assist/Transact/Resolve/Grow). For EACH lifecycle stage: (1) define what the stage covers for this client's domain, (2) name the **solution(s)** that apply — Digital Banking · Conversational Banking · Relationship Intelligence · Customer Operations — and the **control-plane layers** they rely on (Nexus truth, Sentinel governance), (3) describe the concrete change as a **Customer Resolution Loop** where relevant, and (4) quantify against the **three value pools**. Authoritative product mapping: `knowledge/product/banking-os.md` §3–4. The lifecycle stages below are a *narrative aid* — the canonical taxonomy is the three value pools.]

| Lifecycle Stage | Definition (for this domain) | Banking OS Solution(s) | What Changes | Business Outcome → Value Pool |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Acquire** | [Define for domain — e.g., Retail: "Attract prospects, convert them, complete digital onboarding"] | [e.g., "**Digital Banking** (digital onboarding, lending origination); **Customer Operations** (KYC Resolution Loop); grounded in **Nexus** truth, governed by **Sentinel**"] | [e.g., "Onboarding becomes a governed Resolution Loop: capture intent → coordinate KYC/funding across systems → return an opened account; STP for low-risk, human handoff where needed"] | [e.g., "+20% conversion, 7 days→<48hrs → **conversion/cross-sell/retention pool**"] |
| **Activate** | [Define for domain — e.g., Retail: "Get customers transacting — first payment, card activation, daily banking"] | [e.g., "**Digital Banking** (daily banking, card activation); **Conversational Banking — Assist/Transact** (\"Just Ask\": activate card, check status)"] | [e.g., "Mobile-first daily banking; customers self-serve routine actions conversationally instead of calling/branch"] | [e.g., "Digital adoption 30%→65% → **cost-to-serve pool**"] |
| **Expand** | [Define for domain — e.g., Retail: "Cross-sell on behavior & life events" / Wealth: "Grow AUM via advisory"] | [e.g., "**Relationship Intelligence** (Financial Wellness + Share of Wallet, pre-built Plays); **Conversational Banking — Grow** (timely next-best-action moments)"] | [e.g., "Proactive, bank-owned nudges at financial-progress moments replace generic campaigns; RM sees opportunities on one shared truth"] | [e.g., "Products/customer 1.8→2.5 → **conversion/cross-sell/retention pool**"] |
| **Retain** | [Define for domain — e.g., Retail: "Self-service ops, efficient resolution, churn prevention"] | [e.g., "**Customer Operations** (dispute/payment/servicing Resolution Loops); **Conversational Banking — Resolve** (turn needs into governed resolution); all governed & auditable by **Sentinel**"] | [e.g., "Top servicing tasks become governed Resolution Loops: capture intent → coordinate fulfilment → return outcome; agents and humans share full context"] | [e.g., "20%→60% digital containment, cost-to-serve −30% → **cost-to-serve pool**"] |

### Bird's-Eye Benefits View

[High-level benefits summary for Phase 1. Single headline number with breakdown.]

**[Client] stands to gain $[X]-[Y] million over 5 years**

| Value Driver | 5-Year Value | Type |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| [Driver 1 — e.g., Prospecting] | $[X]M | Revenue Uplift |
| [Driver 2 — e.g., Onboarding Efficiency] | $[X]M | Cost Avoidance |
| [Driver 3 — e.g., Servicing Shift] | $[X]M | Cost Avoidance |
| [Driver 4 — e.g., RM Capacity] | $[X]M | Productivity |
| **Total** | **$[X]-[Y]M** | |

## 04. Engagement Approach

[Describe the consulting methodology used: discovery interviews, data analysis, workshops, benchmarking. Keep brief.]

### Deliverables Produced

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Business Case** | Financial model with 5-year projection and sensitivity analysis |
| **Capability Assessment** | Front-to-back maturity heatmap (0-4 scale) with problem traceability |
| **Journey Assessment** | Current-state process maps with friction points and improvement recommendations |
| **Solution Architecture** | Proposed platform architecture and integration approach |

---

## 05. Summary — Challenges & Impact, Recommendations & Value

### Across the Customer Lifecycle

[For EACH lifecycle stage, provide a two-page spread: Challenges & Impact, then Recommendations & Value. This is the core of the assessment.]

> **Method — read the funnels as Customer Resolution Loops.** Each "value leakage funnel" below is a **broken customer-intent loop** where **time · contact · evidence · ownership** leak across the bank's ~60% whitespace between systems (`banking-os.md` §9). For each stage: capture the customer intent → map where the resolution leaks → size the leak → frame the fix as a governed **Customer Resolution Loop** (capture intent → coordinate fulfilment → return outcome) on the Banking OS. Tie every recommendation to a **solution** (Digital Banking · Conversational Banking · Relationship Intelligence · Customer Operations) and a **value pool** — not to a deprecated product name. For AI/agentic and operations sizing, use the APA Domain Matrix value-bleed engine (`knowledge/domains/apa-matrix/`).

## 06. Who to Serve — Persona Mapping

### Addressable Market

[Market segmentation and sizing. Show segments, their share of the customer base, and their strategic importance.]

| Segment | % of Customer Base | % of Revenue | Strategic Priority |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Segment 1] | [X]% | [Y]% | [High/Medium] |
| [Segment 2] | [X]% | [Y]% | [High/Medium] |
| [Segment 3] | [X]% | [Y]% | [High/Medium] |

### Customer Personas

[For each key persona, provide a profile card. Make it human — name, quote, characteristics, needs, pain points.]

#### [Persona Name] — [Segment Label]

> "[Quote that captures their mindset]"

- **Profile:** [Age range, occupation, financial situation]
- **Banking Needs:** [What they need from the bank]
- **Current Pain:** [What frustrates them today]
- **Digital Expectation:** [What they expect from digital channels]
- **Opportunity:** [How the bank can win this persona]

[Repeat for 2-4 personas]

---

## 07. How to Serve Them — Journey Assessment

[For EACH key journey in scope, provide a four-part assessment: Journey Map (As-Is) → Friction Analysis → Business Benefits → Proposed Solution. This is where the assessment goes deepest into the customer and employee experience.]

---

### Journey: [Journey Name — e.g., "Prospect Lounge & Digital Onboarding"]

#### Journey Map (As-Is)

[Full current-state journey map as a swim-lane process flow. Show each actor as a lane, each step as a stage, and mark friction points explicitly.]

**Actors Involved:** [List — e.g., RM, Back-office, Compliance, Marketing, Customer]
**Applications Involved:** [List — e.g., Core banking, CRM, Excel, Email, Paper forms]

| Stage | [Actor 1 — e.g., RM] | [Actor 2 — e.g., Back-office] | [Actor 3 — e.g., Compliance] | [Actor 4 — e.g., Customer] |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| **[Stage 1 — e.g., Opportunity Identification]** | [Actions] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] |
| **[Stage 2 — e.g., Lead Qualification]** | [Actions] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] |
| **[Stage 3 — e.g., Document Collection]** | [Actions] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] |
| **[Stage 4 — e.g., KYC & Screening]** | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] | [Actions] | [Actions or —] |
| **[Stage 5 — e.g., Account Opening]** | [Actions or —] | [Actions] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] |
| **[Stage 6 — e.g., Confirmation]** | [Actions] | [Actions or —] | [Actions or —] | [Actions] |

#### Friction Points

[For each friction point discovered, document the impact on both customer and employee experience]

| # | Friction Point | Stage | Actor Affected | Customer Impact | Employee Impact | Evidence |
|---|---------------|-------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| F1 | [e.g., "Manual document exchange via email"] | [Stage 3] | [RM, Customer] | [e.g., "Delays, repeated requests"] | [e.g., "40 min per application chasing docs"] | [E-IDs] |
| F2 | [Friction] | [Stage] | [Actor] | [Impact] | [Impact] | [E-IDs] |

**Total end-to-end time:** [X days/hours]
**Manual handoffs:** [Count]
**Systems involved:** [Count]
**RM time per case:** [X hours]
**Back-office time per case:** [X hours]

#### Business Benefits

[Quantified benefits from improving this journey. Show the math transparently.]

**Total Annual Benefits: $[X]-[Y]**

| Benefit Category | Annual Impact | Basis |
|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Revenue uplift** | $[X] | [Calculation — e.g., "+X% conversion × Y prospects × $Z LTV"] |
| **Cost avoidance** | $[X] | [Calculation — e.g., "X hrs saved × Y cases × $Z/hr"] |
| **Total** | **$[X]** | |

**How Benefits Are Calculated:**

| Metric | Current | Target | Delta | Annual Value |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|-------------|
| [e.g., "Onboarding cycle time"] | [Baseline] | [Target] | [Delta] | [$ impact] |
| [e.g., "RM time per case"] | [Baseline] | [Target] | [Delta] | [$ impact] |
| [e.g., "Completion rate"] | [Baseline] | [Target] | [Delta] | [$ impact] |

#### Proposed Solution

[Describe the to-be state. What changes, what technology enables it, what the user experience looks like for both customer and employee.]

**What good looks like:**
[Reference 1-2 external examples of banks/fintechs that have achieved this. Use market context research if available, otherwise use domain knowledge. These examples make the solution tangible — not hypothetical.]

> *[e.g., "DBS processes 90% of retail account openings digitally in under 10 minutes. Monzo onboards in <5 minutes with real-time eKYC. This is the standard [Client]'s customers now benchmark against."]*

**Backbase solution components:**

| Component | Backbase Product | What It Does | OOTB / Extend |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| [e.g., "Journey Orchestration"] | [e.g., "Onboarding Orchestrator"] | [e.g., "End-to-end process automation with STP rules"] | [OOTB] |
| [e.g., "Identity Verification"] | [e.g., "eIDV Integration"] | [e.g., "Automated document capture + liveness check"] | [Extend] |
| [e.g., "Exception Handling"] | [e.g., "Case Manager"] | [e.g., "Staff handle only exceptions with full context"] | [OOTB] |

**Target outcomes:**
- End-to-end time: [X days] → [Y hours]
- Completion rate: [X]% → [Y]%
- STP rate: [X]% → [Y]%
- RM time per case: [X hrs] → [Y hrs]

---

[Repeat Journey Assessment (Journey Map → Friction → Benefits → Solution) for each in-scope journey]

---

## 08. Application Architecture

### Current State (As-Is)

[Describe the current technology landscape. List systems, integration patterns, and architectural pain points.]

| Layer | Systems | Integration | Pain Points |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Channels** | [List] | [e.g., "Siloed per channel"] | [e.g., "No shared state"] |
| **Orchestration** | [List or "None"] | [e.g., "Point-to-point"] | [e.g., "No BPM, manual handoffs"] |
| **Core Systems** | [List] | [e.g., "Batch, limited API"] | [e.g., "Legacy, slow change cycles"] |

### Proposed State (To-Be)

[Describe the target architecture with Backbase platform positioned. Show the orchestration layer, integration approach, and progressive modernization path.]

| Layer | Proposed | Integration | Benefit |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Unified Frontline** | [Backbase web/mobile apps, employee portal] | [Unified UX layer] | [Consistent CX, single codebase] |
| **Orchestration** | [Backbase platform + BPM engine] | [API-first, event-driven] | [End-to-end journeys, STP] |
| **Integration** | [Integration layer / API gateway] | [REST APIs, real-time] | [Decoupled, scalable] |
| **Core Systems** | [Existing — no change required] | [Wrapped with APIs] | [Protect investment, progressive] |

### Architecture Transformation Journey

[Visual concept showing the progressive modernization path from as-is to to-be. This should be rendered as a visual diagram in the presentation — showing how the architecture evolves across phases, with the Backbase platform progressively wrapping existing systems.]

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** Backbase orchestration layer sits on top of existing core → wraps legacy with APIs → enables digital journeys without replacing core

**Phase 2 (Differentiation):** Intelligence layer added → data foundation feeds analytics → proactive engagement capabilities enabled

**Phase 3 (Acceleration):** AI/agentic layer → self-optimizing journeys → predictive servicing → human-in-the-loop for exceptions only

*[NOTE FOR PRESENTATION RENDERING: This section should be visualized as a layered architecture diagram with progressive phase overlays — showing the "before" state as siloed blocks, and the "after" state as a unified platform with orchestration layer. Use the presentation skill's architecture scene type.]*

*[NARRATIVE BRIDGE: "The journey assessments above reveal specific friction points in how [Client] serves its customers. But these frictions are symptoms of deeper capability gaps. The following section maps the bank's front-to-back capability maturity — showing exactly where the architectural weaknesses lie and what level of capability is needed to deliver the journeys described above."]*

# SECTION 5: Capability Assessment

---

## 09. Front-to-Back Capability Heatmap

### Assessment Methodology

**Scale:** 0-4 Maturity (Absent → Fragmented → Defined → Orchestrated → Intelligent)
**Structure:** Every capability assessed across Front Layer (Experience) / Middle Layer (Capability/Orchestration) / Back Layer (Integration + Systems of Record)
**Scoring Rule:** Overall score = weakest layer. The chain breaks at the weakest link.
**Bias:** Conservative. Score what exists, not what's planned.

### Problem Map

**Considered Needs** (What [Client] Already Knows):

| # | Problem | Severity | Impact | Evidence | Related Capabilities |
|---|---------|----------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| CN-01 | [Problem] | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] | [Quantified impact] | [E-IDs] | [CAP-IDs] |
