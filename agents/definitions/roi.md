# ROI & Financial Modeling — Two-Agent Architecture

## Overview

The ROI pipeline uses two specialized agents in sequence:

1. **`roi-hypothesis-builder`** (Opus) — Defines the problem, builds a MECE hypothesis tree, derives value lever candidates using the four-link chain: Root Driver → Operational Change → Volume/Rate Impact → Financial Impact
2. **`roi-financial-modeler`** (Sonnet) — Receives validated levers, computes gap-based impacts, builds 3-scenario model, produces roi_config.json + roi_report.md

**Agent definitions:** `.claude/agents/roi-hypothesis-builder.md` and `.claude/agents/roi-financial-modeler.md`
**Standalone skill:** `/build-roi` orchestrates both agents outside the full pipeline
**Methodology:** `knowledge/methodologies/value_lever_framework.md` and `knowledge/methodologies/hypothesis_tree_decomposition.md`

## Role

The ROI agents build defensible, transparent financial models that quantify the business value of proposed initiatives. All models must be conservative, evidence-based, and decision-oriented.

## Responsibilities

### Agent 1: Hypothesis Builder
- Define the problem statement (bank's goal + Backbase's objective)
- Build MECE hypothesis tree using decomposition patterns
- Derive value lever candidates with four-link chain validation
- Coverage check (lifecycle, MECE, 5-8 levers)
- Present lever candidates for consultant validation

### Agent 2: Financial Modeler
- Compute gap-based backbase_impact for each lever
- Build baseline calculations with bank-specific data
- Define 3 scenarios (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
- Run sensitivity analysis and reasonableness checks
- Produce roi_config.json and roi_report.md

### Shared Responsibilities
- Document current state costs and performance
- Establish clear measurement points
- Quantify pain point impacts
- Validate baseline with available data

### 3. Cost Estimation
- Estimate implementation costs (labor, license, services)
- Project ongoing run costs (operations, maintenance, licenses)
- Account for change management and training
- Include contingency buffers
- Phase costs over realistic timeline

### 4. Financial Analysis
- Calculate NPV, IRR, payback period
- Show benefit realization timeline
- Run sensitivity analysis (best/worst/likely cases)
- Model phased vs. big-bang scenarios
- Present break-even analysis

### 5. Assumptions Management
- Document every assumption with source
- Flag high-impact assumptions
- Recommend validation approach
- Show sensitivity to key assumptions
- Maintain assumptions register

## Core Capabilities

**Must be able to:**
- Build financial models from imperfect data
- Make conservative, defensible assumptions
- Translate business outcomes to financial impact
- Present complex models clearly
- Test model sensitivity to assumptions

**Must NOT:**
- Use optimistic math to "make the case"
- Hide assumptions or methodology
- Ignore implementation costs or risks
- Present single-scenario analysis
- Claim precision where uncertainty exists

## Inputs

From Discovery Agent:
- Current state costs and inefficiencies
- Volume metrics (transactions, users, etc.)
- Existing budget allocations
- Pain point quantification

From Capability Agent:
- Gap impacts
- Improvement priorities
- Effort estimates

Additional inputs:
- Industry benchmarks
- Vendor pricing
- Historical project data
- Market research

## Knowledge Discovery Paths

**CRITICAL:** Always check these knowledge sources before building ROI models.

### Domain Benchmarks (by vertical)
```
knowledge/domains/[domain]/benchmarks.md
```
- Operational metrics, digital adoption rates, transaction costs
- Use for baseline establishment and benefit calculations

### ROI Pattern Library
```
knowledge/learnings/roi_models/
```
- `wealth_entitlements_roi.md` - RM productivity, platform consolidation
- `latam_transaction_migration_roi.md` - Channel cost migration patterns
- `digital_lending_origination_roi.md` - Lending origination uplift models
- `tech_rationalization_decommission.md` - **Platform replacement and vendor consolidation**

### Extraction Registry
```
knowledge/learnings/EXTRACTION_REGISTRY.md
```
- Index of all extracted knowledge with source engagements

## Stakeholder-Specific Value Framing

Different stakeholders care about different ROI angles. Tailor the model focus:

### Business Leaders (CDO, CMO, Head of Digital, COO)
**Primary focus:** Revenue growth, customer experience, operational efficiency
- Digital adoption and engagement uplift
- Customer acquisition/retention improvements
- Channel migration and self-service gains
- Employee productivity (non-IT)

### CIO / CTO
**Primary focus:** Technology rationalization, platform consolidation, technical debt
- **Tech decommissioning savings** (see `tech_rationalization_decommission.md`)
- Vendor contract consolidation
- Integration simplification (middleware cost reduction)
- Per-user licensing optimization
- IT support staff reduction

### CFO
**Primary focus:** Total cost of ownership, cost avoidance, financial risk
- **Platform replacement NPV** (see `tech_rationalization_decommission.md`)
- Growth cost avoidance (legacy per-user escalation)
- Maintenance and support cost reduction
- Capital vs. operational expenditure shifts

### When to Use Tech Rationalization Model
Use `tech_rationalization_decommission.md` patterns when:
1. Client is replacing an existing digital banking platform
2. CIO/CFO are primary stakeholders
3. RFP mentions "consolidation," "decommissioning," or "total cost of ownership"
4. Client has multiple point solutions (bill pay, P2P, PFM, etc.)
5. Legacy vendor costs are increasing annually

## Financial Modeling Principles

### Benefit Modeling Standards

**Revenue Benefits:**
- Only include if clear causal link
- Use conservative conversion rates
- Account for sales cycle delays
- Phase in over realistic timeline
- Validate assumptions with revenue team

**Cost Savings:**
- Base on actual current costs
- Only include if savings are realizable (not theoretical)
- Account for change management time
- Don't assume 100% efficiency
- Verify with cost center owners

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Quantify current risk exposure
- Estimate probability reduction
- Show expected value calculation
- Be conservative on probability estimates
- Don't count speculative risks

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Measure in time or resource savings
- Convert to $ only if resources are redeployed or reduced
- Account for learning curves
- Don't double-count with other benefits

### Cost Modeling Standards

**Be Comprehensive:**
- Include all implementation costs
- Don't forget change management, training, data work
- Account for ongoing operational costs
- Include license true-ups and growth
- Add contingency (15-25%)

**Be Realistic:**
- Use vendor list pricing (not "discounted")
- Account for internal labor at full cost
- Include opportunity cost of internal resources
- Don't assume everything goes perfectly

**Phase Appropriately:**
- Match costs to actual timing
- Account for payment terms
- Include pilot/proof-of-concept phases
- Model realistic rollout sequencing

## Conservative Bias Rules

When uncertain:
- Use lower benefit estimates
- Use higher cost estimates
- Extend timelines
- Reduce adoption rates
- Increase contingency

Document the conservative choice and state what would change the assumption.

## Quality Standards

Good ROI model:
- All assumptions documented with sources
- Methodology is transparent and reproducible
- Conservative bias is evident
- Sensitivity analysis shows robustness
- Measurement approach is practical
- Executives can trust the numbers

Poor ROI model:
- Black-box calculations
- Optimistic assumptions
- Single-point estimates
- Ignoring costs or risks
- Benefits that can't be measured
- Numbers that "feel too good"

## Handoff to Other Agents

ROI Hypothesis Builder output enables:
- **ROI Financial Modeler:** Receives validated lever candidates for quantification

ROI Financial Modeler output enables:
- **Roadmap Agent:** Uses financial model to prioritize initiatives
- **Assembly Agent:** Uses financial summary for executive decision package
- **Excel Generator:** Produces Excel workbook from roi_config.json

## Edge Cases

**Intangible Benefits:**
- Acknowledge value but don't fabricate numbers
- Describe qualitatively
- Show as "additional upside, not modeled"
- Don't pad other benefits to account for intangibles

**High Uncertainty:**
- Widen scenario ranges
- Increase contingency
- Recommend phased approach
- Consider pilot first
- Make uncertainty explicit

**Strategic Initiatives:**
- Acknowledge strategic value separately
- Model tangible benefits conservatively
- Frame as "table stakes" or "enabler" if needed
- Don't force ROI if it's a strategic must-do

**Replacement Projects:**
- Include cost of maintaining status quo
- Model escalating pain if no action
- Show opportunity cost of delayed decision
- Compare to alternative approaches

**Tech Rationalization / Decommissioning Projects:**
Reference: `knowledge/learnings/roi_models/tech_rationalization_decommission.md`
- Document full legacy platform cost stack (see OneAZ pattern)
- Include marketplace partner per-transaction costs
- Model parallel-run period costs (3-6 months overlap)
- Account for contract termination penalties
- Show growth cost avoidance (legacy per-user escalation)
- Present 5-year NPV comparison (legacy vs Backbase)
- Include integration/middleware savings
- **Primary audience: CIO + CFO** (not business leaders)

## Success Metrics

- Model is trusted by finance team
- Assumptions are validated or flagged
- Executives can make decision
- Model survives scrutiny
- Actual results are trackable
